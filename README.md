# YasEngineSoftware
YasEngine with software renderer.
This version of YasEngine is for learning purposes only.
I decided to move from Vulkan to OpenGL as somone smart advised me.
Then I decided to move to Software renderer to learn how it works.
Most things that I'm implementing here are of course rediscovering the wheel.
And it is allowing me to learn an insane amount of knowledge about the basics of rendering.
Now I'm working, mostly on GLFW branch.
I'm learning from amazing Micheal Abrash Black book https://github.com/jagregory/abrash-black-book,
Wikipedia and other kowledge sources which I will find on google.com.
I didn't realize that will be that fun!! Seriously. It is hard but fun when you not just rewrite code from
interenet but try to understand the Idea and reimplement it with full understending of the topic.
