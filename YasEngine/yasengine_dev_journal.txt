I will be implementing engine iteratively, by building working game or working
part of game.

First mile stone is:
Implementing posibility to draw 3D
regular hexahedrons (cubes)
and rectangular cuboids
defined by vertices, positiion, color
rendering pipline for that kind of simple wireframe objects
scaling of object
transofrming objects
and rotating objects
scene as simple list of objects
camera will be attached to player
so it will be implemented moving camera using WSAD keys and mouse.
